# SageMaker Deployment Project

Sentiment Analysis Web App is a notebook and collection of Python files to be completed. The result is a RNN performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint. This is built using AWS SageMaker, AWS Lambda, and AWS API Gateway.
